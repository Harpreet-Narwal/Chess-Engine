Chesss Engine: A chess engine is a computer program that is designed to play chess. Chess engines use algorithms to analyze the game and make the best possible move based on the current position on the chessboard. These programs are used to play against human opponents, other chess engines, or to analyze games for training or educational purposes.
Most modern chess engines use a combination of techniques, including brute-force search, alpha-beta pruning, and heuristics, to evaluate possible moves and select the best one. These programs can often defeat even the strongest human players and are a valuable tool for studying and improving one's own chess game.
